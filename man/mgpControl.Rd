\usage{
mgpControl(alpha.d1 = 2.1,
           alpha.d2 = 3.1,
           phi.hyper = c(3, 2),
           sigma.hyper = c(3, 2),
           prop = 0.7,
           eps = 0.1,
           adapt = TRUE,
           cluster.shrink = TRUE,
           b0 = 0.1,
           b1 = 5e-05,
           beta.d1 = 1,
           beta.d2 = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{alpha.d1}{Shape hyperparameter of the column shrinkage on the first column of the loadings according to the MGP shrinkage prior. Passed to \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure validity. Defaults to \code{2.1}.}

\item{alpha.d2}{Shape hyperparameter of the column shrinkage on the subsequent columns of the loadings according to the MGP shrinkage prior. Passed to \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure validity. Defaults to \code{3.1}.}

\item{phi.hyper}{A vector of length 2 giving the shape and rate hyperparameters for the gamma prior on the local shrinkage parameters. Passed to \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure validity. Defaults to \code{c(3, 2)}. It is suggested that the rate be <= shape minus 1 to induce local shrinkage, though the cumulative shrinkage property is unaffected by these hyperparameters. Excessively small values may lead to critical numerical issues and should thus be avoided; indeed it is \emph{suggested} that the shape be >=1.}

\item{sigma.hyper}{A vector of length 2 giving the shape and rate hyperparameters for the gamma prior on the cluster shrinkage parameters. Passed to \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure validity. Defaults to \code{c(3, 2)}. Again, it is \emph{suggested} that the shape be >= 1. Only relevant for the "\code{IMIFA}", "\code{OMIFA}", and "\code{MIFA}" methods when \code{isTRUE(cluster.shrink)}.}

\item{prop}{Proportion of loadings elements within the neighbourhood \code{eps} of zero necessary to consider a loadings column redundant. Defaults to \code{floor(0.7 * P)/P}, where \code{P} is the number of variables in the data set. However, if the data set is univariate or bivariate, the default is \code{0.5} (see Note).}

\item{eps}{Neighbourhood epsilon of zero within which a loadings entry is considered negligible according to \code{prop}. Defaults to 0.1.}

\item{adapt}{A logical value indicating whether adaptation of the number of cluster-specific factors is to take place when the MGP prior is employed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Specifying \code{FALSE} and supplying \code{range.Q} within \code{\link{mcmc_IMIFA}} provides a means to either approximate the infinite factor model with a fixed high truncation level, or to use the MGP prior in a finite factor context, however this is NOT recommended for the "\code{OMIFA}" and "\code{IMIFA}" methods.}

\item{cluster.shrink}{A logical value indicating whether to place the prior specified by \code{sigma.hyper} on the cluster shrinkage parameters. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Specifying \code{FALSE} is equivalent to fixing all cluster shrinkage parameters to 1. Only relevant for the "\code{IMIFA}", "\code{OMIFA}", and "\code{MIFA}" methods. If invoked, the posterior mean cluster shrinkage factors will be reported.}

\item{b0, b1}{Intercept & slope parameters for the exponentially decaying adaptation probability:

\code{p(iter) = 1/exp(b0 + b1 * (iter - start.AGS))}.

Defaults to 0.1 & 0.00005, respectively. Must be non-negative and strictly positive, respectively, to ensure diminishing adaptation.}

\item{beta.d1}{Rate hyperparameter of the column shrinkage on the first column of the loadings according to the MGP shrinkage prior. Passed to \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure validity. Defaults to 1.}

\item{beta.d2}{Rate hyperparameter of the column shrinkage on the subsequent columns of the loadings according to the MGP shrinkage prior. Passed to \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure validity. Defaults to 1.}

\item{start.AGS}{The iteration at which adaptation under the AGS is to begin. Defaults to \code{burnin} for the "\code{IFA}" and "\code{MIFA}" methods, defaults to 0 for the "\code{OMIFA}" and "\code{IMIFA}" methods, and defaults to 0 for all methods if the data set is univariate or bivariate. Cannot exceed \code{burnin}.}

\item{stop.AGS}{The iteration at which adaptation under the AGS is to stop completely. Defaults to \code{Inf}, such that the AGS is never explicitly forced to stop (thereby overriding the diminishing adaptation probability after \code{stop.AGS}). Must be greater than \code{start.AGS}. The diminishing adaptation probability prior to \code{stop.AGS} is still governed by the arguments \code{b0} and \code{b1}.}

\item{delta0g}{Logical indicating whether the \code{alpha.d1} and \code{alpha.d2} hyperparameters can be cluster-specific. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Only relevant for the "\code{MIFA}" method and only allowed when \code{z.list} is supplied within \code{\link{mcmc_IMIFA}}.}

\item{...}{Catches unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A named list in which the names are the names of the arguments related to the MGP and AGS and the values are the values supplied to the arguments.
}
\description{
Supplies a list of arguments for use in \code{\link{mcmc_IMIFA}} pertaining to the use of the multiplicative gamma process (MGP) shrinkage prior and adaptive Gibbs sampler (AGS) for use with the infinite factor models "\code{IFA}", "\code{MIFA}", "\code{OMIFA}", and "\code{IMIFA}".
}
\note{
Certain supplied arguments will be subject to further checks by \code{\link{MGP_check}} to ensure the cumulative shrinkage property of the MGP prior holds according to the given parameterisation.

The adaptive Gibbs sampler (AGS) monitors the \code{prop} of loadings elements within the neighbourhood \code{eps} of 0 and discards columns or simulates new columns on this basis. However, if at any stage the number of group-specific latent factors reaches zero, the decision to add columns is instead based on a simple binary trial with probability \code{1-prop}, as there are no loadings entries to monitor.

\examples{
mgpctrl <- mgpControl(phi.hyper=c(2.5, 1), eps=1e-02)

# data(olive)
# sim   <- mcmc_IMIFA(olive, "IMIFA", n.iters=5000, MGP=mgpctrl)

# Alternatively specify these arguments directly
# sim   <- mcmc_IMIFA(olive, "IMIFA", n.iters=5000, phi.hyper=c(2.5, 1), eps=1e-02)
