	abstract = {We focus on sparse modelling of high-dimensional covariance matrices using Bayesian latent factor models. We propose a multiplicative gamma process shrinkage prior on the factor loadings which allows introduction of infinitely many factors, with the loadings increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. We use our prior on a parameter-expanded loading matrix to avoid the order dependence typical in factor analysis models and develop an efficient Gibbs sampler that scales well as data dimensionality increases. The gain in efficiency is achieved by the joint conjugacy property of the proposed prior, which allows block updating of the loadings matrix. We propose an adaptive Gibbs sampler for automatically truncating the infinite loading matrix through selection of the number of important factors. Theoretical results are provided on the support of the prior and truncation approximation bounds. A fast algorithm is proposed to produce approximate Bayes estimates. Latent factor regression methods are developed for prediction and variable selection in applications with high-dimensional correlated predictors. Operating characteristics are assessed through simulation studies, and the approach is applied to predict survival times from gene expression data.},

	abstract = {Statistical mixture distributions are used to model scenarios in which certain variables are measured but a categorical variable is missing. For example, although clinical data on a patient may be available their disease category may not be, and this adds significant degrees of complication to the statistical analysis. The above situation characterises the simplest mixture-type scenario; variations include, among others, hidden Markov models, in which the missing variable follows a Markov chain model, and latent structure models, in which the missing variable or variables represent model-enriching devices rather than real physical entities. In the title of the workshop the term `mixture' is taken to include these and other variations along with the simple mixture. The motivating factors for this three-day workshop are that research on inference and computational techniques for mixture-type models is currently experiencing major advances and that simultaneously the application of mixture modelling to many fields in science and elsewhere has never been so rich. We thus assembling top players, from statistics and computer science, in both methodological research and applied inference at this fertile interface. The methodological component will involve both Bayesian and non-Bayesian contributions and biology and economics will feature strongly among the application areas to be covered.},
