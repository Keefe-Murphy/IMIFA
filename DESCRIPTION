Description: Provides flexible Gibbs sampler functions for fitting Infinite Mixtures of Infinite Factor Analysers and related models, introduced by Murphy et al. (2017) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07010>, which conducts Bayesian nonparametric model-based clustering with factor analytic covariance structures without recourse to model selection criteria to choose the number of clusters or cluster-specific latent factors. Model-specific diagnostic tools are also provided, as well as many options for plotting results and conducting posterior inference on parameters of interest.
