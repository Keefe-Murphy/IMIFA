Description: Provides flexible Gibbs sampler function for fitting the full suite of IMIFA related models, which allows model based clustering with factor analytic covariance structures without recourse to model selection criteria to choose the number of clusters or cluster-specific latent factors. Model-specific diagnostic tools are also provided, as well as many options for plotting results and posterior distributions of parameters of inferential interest.
